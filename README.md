This project demonstrates the deployment and management of a cloud-hosted infrastructure using Microsoft Azure. The repository documents the end-to-end process of provisioning an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS virtual machine in the Korea Central region, configuring virtual firewalls through Network Security Groups (NSGs) to manage SSH, ICMP, and HTTP traffic, and validating bi-directional network connectivity. Additionally, the project includes the deployment of a functional web application on Port 80 using Nginx, which integrates a JavaScript-based Dictionary API to fetch and display real-time data. To ensure cost-efficiency and security, the project concludes with the complete termination and deletion of all associated cloud resources.
